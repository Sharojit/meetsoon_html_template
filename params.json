You can feel free to use this is for your project. But i think you need to edit and update with all latest vendor plugins first because i already used older version of those plugins. Also you can check on my <a href=\"http://www.sharojit.com/\" title=\"Freelancer Web Developer\">website</a> for get the update, if i can manage time for update it. \r\n",
